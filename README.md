# ECE373
[Course Description](https://www.pdx.edu/electrical-computer-engineering/ece-373-embedded-operating-systems-and-device-drivers): ECE 373 extends the microprocessor interfacing skills gained in ECE 372 to the design of hardware and device drivers for a microprocessor system with an embedded operating system. After a brief introduction to the basic structure and operations of the Linux OS, students will gain extensive practice developing Linux device drivers for a wide variety of hardware devices. Course will also include discussions of security and power management techniques commonly used in embedded microprocessors systems.
